Hello there! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub page! I'm Jessica, also known as Jess. I'm based in Florianópolis, Brazil, and I work as a QA Engineer.

🎓 I'm currently pursuing my undergraduate degree in Information Systems, and I have been working as a QA for almost 5 years now. It's been quite a journey!

💡 When it comes to technology, I have a strong affinity for JavaScript/Typescript and Python. Additionally, I have experience with test frameworks such as Cypress, Playwright and Selenium. Testing is my area of expertise!

🐾 I'm an animal lover, and I'm lucky to have two adorable companions in my life. Pingo and Zoe, my canine pals.

📧 Please feel free to reach out to me via [e-mail](mailto:jessica_schelly@hotmail.com.com) if you have any questions or would like to connect.
